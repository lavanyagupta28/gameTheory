        "In a rapidly growing city, five major firms are competing to meet the increasing demand for clean energy by producing and installing solar panels. The city government has incentivized solar energy, but there is a limit to how many solar panels can be installed due to space constraints. Each firm must decide how many solar panels to produce and install each year, knowing that the total number of panels produced by all firms will affect the market price.\n",
